# Forecasting Pipeline â€” Synthetic Data Example

This repository contains a **portfolio-ready** example of a forecasting pipeline built with Python.  
It demonstrates endâ€‘toâ€‘end steps on **synthetic data**: data generation, demand segmentation via clustering, and segmentâ€‘specific forecasting models (naive/ESMâ€‘like for regular demand and **Croston** for intermittent demand).

> âœ… All data in this repo is synthetic and safe to share publicly.

## âœ¨ What youâ€™ll find here

- **Synthetic time series generation** for thousands of products
- **Feature engineering**: total volume, sales frequency, ADI (Average Demand Interval), CVÂ² (squared coefficient of variation)
- **Demand segmentation** using **Kâ€‘Means** on ADI and CVÂ²
- **Forecasting**:
  - Regular segment â†’ simple average (naive / ESMâ€‘like simulation)
  - Intermittent segment â†’ **Crostonâ€™s method** (smoothed demand / smoothed interval)
- Clean, tutorialâ€‘style **notebook** with English comments

â”œâ”€â”€ FULL_FORECAST_PIPELINE.ipynb   # Main tutorial notebook
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                      # You are here
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt               # Minimal dependencies
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore                     # Ignore cache/checkpoints

> Tip: If you later add small sample CSVs, place them in a `data/` folder and keep them lightweight (< 10 MB).

## ðŸ§ª Environment setup

> Works on Python **3.9+**. Create a virtual environment (recommended).

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scriptsctivate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook FULL_FORECAST_PIPELINE.ipynb
```

## ðŸ”¬ Method overview

### Feature engineering
- **Total_Volume**: sum of units sold
- **Num_Periods_Sold**: number of periods with nonâ€‘zero sales
- **ADI**: average time gap (in months) between sales events
- **CVÂ²**: (std / mean)Â² of demand size

### Segmentation (Kâ€‘Means)
We cluster products in the **(ADI, CVÂ²)** space into two groups.  
The cluster with **more sales periods** is labeled **Regular**; the other is **Intermittent**.

### Forecasting
- **Regular**: uses the historical **mean** as a simple baseline (similar flavor to a basic Exponential Smoothing in stability).
- **Intermittent**: implements **Crostonâ€™s method**â€”exponential smoothing of **demand sizes** and **intervals** separately; forecast = smoothed_demand / smoothed_interval.

> This is intentionally simple and explainable for portfolio purposes. In production, you could upgrade to ETS/ARIMA/Prophet/LSTM or intermittent variants (SBA/TSB).

## ðŸ“ˆ Reproducing results

1. Open the notebook and run all cells sequentially.  
2. Youâ€™ll see:
   - Segment counts (Regular vs Intermittent)
   - Segment profiles (average ADI, CVÂ², volume)
   - Forecast samples for both segments

---

## ðŸ§© Customization ideas

- Visualize clusters (scatter of **ADI vs CVÂ²**, color by segment)
- Add accuracy metrics (MAE/RMSE/MAPE) using a train/test split
- Swap Kâ€‘Means for another clustering method (e.g., Gaussian Mixtures)
- Replace the naive forecast with ETS or stateâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘art intermittent models
